## Overview
This repository contains my **first Machine Learning project**, which predicts a person's preferred music genre based on their age. It is designed as a simple introduction to supervised learning using **Decision Tree Classifiers**.  

The project also demonstrates how to **visualize a decision tree**, making it easier to understand how the model makes predictions. This visualization helps beginners grasp the flow of decisions in a tree-based classifier.
